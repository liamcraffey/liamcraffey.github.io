							<h2 style="text-align:center">Senior Capstone: Initial Plunge Part 1</h2>
							<pre>
This post marks the end of week 2! 
Over the past week we’ve slightly narrowed our vision and are now focusing on three of our five prototypes: 0g, Bullet Hell, and Lawn Mower (working titles). 
Each now has their own playable digital prototype with which we can start getting feedback from QA. 
However, my main tasks this week focused on customer and competitor research. 
This has emerged in the form of a more robust competitive market spreadsheet while drafting customer archetypes. 
Both of these required me to implement my previous learning and challenged me with unexpected circumstances.
<br>
<!--<img src="material/CompResearch.png" alt="broken" style="height:360px">-->
My basic competition spreadsheet utilizes organization techniques that I implemented during my Minority Media internship. 
Last week I rummaged through Steam and Google play to get a large amount of potential competitors. 
Then I sat down with my designer and we picked through them to really nail down which were competitors while throwing away those that weren’t. 
In addition to this I added SteamSpy statistics to give us a better understanding of the sales for each title. 
While the Steam Review count is a good bare assessment, if you look at the above image you’ll find some that don’t match up. 
Having both information about sales and the level of discussion from the community will give us a better understanding of the market as a whole later down the road.
<br>
Once I had an idea of each market I took on the task of trying to get input from potential early adopters. 
My idea was to go around campus and talk to students about each concept on a given day. 
I figured that with the amount of video game oriented people here at the college I would have an easier time finding customers instead of online or on the street.  
What I found was that most college students on campus in the middle of the day were too busy to discuss at any length about the ideas, let alone try out a concept. 
Looking forward I might try again at different times on different days to test the waters. 
Even further I might make this a continuous routine in order to find all the early adopters on campus that I can.
<br>
After this failure I realized in order to meet my task deadline I had to search online to get an idea of what our customers might be like or what they might value in each concept. 
A great source for this ended up being Steam reviews and Google Play reviews. 
Going over them I was able to get an basic understanding of not only the people playing these games but also what they find most valuable. 
One of my future tasks may be taking a deeper look into these and fleshing out the customer archetypes more.
<br>
This past week was a lot of taking all the information I have and trying to figure out the best possible answers. 
None of the documents I started today are anywhere near final especially since that we don’t have ideas down pat as of yet. 
However, for going onto next semester I believe it is better to get an understanding of both our customers and the markets we are trying to enter as soon as possible. 
In the upcoming weeks I can expand and refine these documents to incorporate any changes we may come upon. 
Additionally, I want to use the failures I’ve encountered this week to better my work into the future. 
With playable prototypes in hand and outlines of where we want to head I believe that we are in a solid place for so soon after the start of the semester. 
Next week we have a simple goal: challenge the Initial Concepts stage. For us to do this requires more paperwork than one might expect. 
Tune in to learn about what exactly this stage entails and what I needed to work on to meet its specifications. Thank you for reading!

						<h2 style="text-align:center">Senior Capstone: Kick-off</h2>
						<pre>
Constantly throughout Champlain College I’ve worked with teams to develop a game. 
Capstone sets itself apart in a major way: there isn’t a teacher providing us with a prompt. 
Instead the team is tasked with creating an idea themselves then taking it as far as they want. 
This provides a lot of different opportunities for teams to build their own path, 
but includes a final presentation at the end for teams to continue onto Senior Production. 
However, the grade of Capstone is not tied to completing this step and gives teams a large amount of freedom. 
They could develop many small prototypes or try to home in onto one idea. 
My team is taking the latter route and currently have five prototypes which we are exploring. 
The following series of blog posts will focus on my perspective of the process which will mainly focus on business, management, and organizational topics. 

For this first week, I took the tasks of starting to create value and growth hypotheses for each idea as well as a first draft business model canvas. 
These names are temporary and are not final.
<br>
<img src="./material/0g1.gif" alt="broken" style="width:640px;height:360px">
0g:
This idea started with the mechanic of being in space with no gravity and having a main part of your movement be a result of firing a gun. 
Players are tasked with infiltrating a space ship from the outside, and must strategically take out key systems to complete their objective. 
A main assumption of this idea is that players want to infiltrate a spaceship from the outside. 
Without this key incentive, they wouldn’t have a reason to play the game at all. 
My next steps for this is to analyze testing feedback and find gamers who play sci-fi games and get their input on the idea.
<br>				<!--<img src="./material/Trench.png" alt="broken img" class="rotate90" style="width:360px;height:640;">-->
Trench Warfare:
Instead of focusing purely onto warfare and strategy we want to throw another element into this idea: people. 
The aim of the game is a real-time strategy (RTS) game that puts players in a situation where they need to consider their people, infrastructure, and enemy. 
The main assumption here is that adding people as a factor they must consider is something people are interested in. 
There is proof of this mechanic being successful, as Darkest Dungeon has shown, but we don’t know how RTS fans will react to it. 
Next steps are to not only talk to RTS fans but get feedback from them during testing.
<br>
Alien Autopsy:
A puzzle game where the answer is hidden inside a complex and mysterious alien body. 
Players must tamper and experiment with the insides to discover its rules and figure out what makes it tick. 
The assumption here is that fans of puzzle games want to experiment in this way. 
This might be the weakest of my hypothesis since it is general. 
Next step is to talk with puzzle fans to see what they think and analyze testing feedback.
<br>
<img src="./material/BulletHell1.gif" alt="broken" style="width:640px;height:360px">
Bullet Hell:
Here we want to flip the traditional base shooting mechanic to giving the player abilities that manipulate the bullets coming at them. 
Once they created a safe path they ram their ship into enemies to kill them. 
The main assumption here is that this change would provide an interesting new twist on the genre enough to entice this fanbase. 
Next step is to talk with bullet hell fans and to gather feedback from testing. 
<br>
Lawn Mower:
The main idea here is to provide a Zen experience in the form of mowing a virtual lawn on their phone. 
We would have several types of lawns with several objects in them. 
Of course, in this regard a main assumption is that players would even want to do this to relax and provide one personal fulfilment. 
This is the idea that I have the least regarding a solid next plan. 
I will need to find avid mobile phone users to better understand the mobile player base. 
After that it would be analysing testing feedback.
<br>
In addition to creating the above I also did some preliminary survey of their markets to find any competitors. 
My main goal was to find titles that provide the same type of value as our ideas. 
For this I am using tactics I learned from interning at Minority Studios by making a spreadsheet to start. 
This has the platform, price, rating, the amount of reviews, along with the product page. 
This will allow us to give a good overview of the market and where it is at regarding player base as well as what they expect from a game within that genre. 
Going forward I will be adding onto this spreadsheet continually as we hone into a specific idea. 
<br>
That’s it for this week in terms of what I’ve done at the start of this project. 
Every week I will be adding another post going over what I’ve done the past week, what the team has done, things I’ve learned, and more. 
Each week will also be influenced on what part of the project we are focusing on that week in terms of getting our game to continue next semester. 
Long story short, this consists of challenging several stages in which we need to build out specific parts of our idea. 
Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy!

						<h2 style="text-align:center">Game Development: The Student Restriction</h2>
						<pre>
This Spring Semester marks the second time that I have worked on a student game development project. 
Before I go into my Senior Capstone, another development cycle, I wanted to collect and share my thoughts on the student process. 
Even during my brief time I've been at Minority Media noticeable differences have been revealed to me. 
This post will provide insights for any project management perspective. 
There are three topics specifically I want to address regarding student compared to studio development; the time frame, the mindset, and the limitations.

While I was preparing to go to MIGS 2016 I heard that the mention of a student project causes an immediate wave of eye-rolling and disinterest.  
This trend, I've been told, extends to GDC and further to industry developers in general. 
As a student, this is disheartening to hear since I want to discuss aspects of the industry with those actually in it. 
However, at the same time, from a student producer perspective this doesn't come as a surprise to me.

A big part of this I feel is the amount of time in general a student has to dedicate to a project. 
Every student has several obligations that they decide to commit time towards. 
I separate these into two categories; school and general activities. 
The school related activities are something unique to student projects, while general related ones are something every studio deals with. 
Yet general activities do not impact a studio developer's time commitment while both school and general activities affect a student's time commitment.

The basis for this is that studios are jobs and as a result the developers are contractually obligated to work on the project. 
A common inclusion into this is a mandatory regular schedule with around eight hours of work a day at the studio. 
During that time employees are expected to work together with their co-workers towards the game. 
This means that on a daily basis, studio developers are working for multiple hours and in close proximity to one another. 
Students do not get either of these privileges that studio developers come to expect. 
This results in a smaller pool of time to commit to a project which is reinforced by the school system itself.

Here is where we start entering the second aspect of student troubles; the student mindset. 
For most students, when they arrive in a college they have been in a school environment for their entire life about 18 years on average. 
As a result, an assumption can be made that they primarily focus on the grade they receive rather than getting fulfilment out of a project. 
A main aspect for going to college is to get away from your home and to figure out who you truly are. 
This effect is compounded by the time commitment since they are more likely to stretch themselves over a number of activities. 
As a result students tend to only dedicate the minimum amount of work to get a good grade.

At Champlain College that minimum amount of "work" is typically defined for them in the class syllabus; eight hours minimum per week. 
While this slightly encourages the students to do the work, it also has a potential limiting factor in how much time they dedicate to the project. 
With the student mindset, commitments and limited time available combine so students have trouble finding the time to work on the project, let alone meet their goals. 
Even senior team members at Champlain College tend to have the mindset where they only need to work eight hours a week. 
This results in a drastically smaller level of commitment and man hours on the typical student project compared to a studio project. 
Additionally, projects only last a semester at most, around four months, which totals around 128 hours of work per student on a project.

This is further compounded through the teachers in the other classes the student is taking. 
They may take a class with a teacher who perceives their class as what the student needs to be focusing on. 
Believing this, the teacher assigns the class a large amount of homework and strictly grades on the work they have submitted. 
Thus, the student is required to spend more time on the class to receive a better grade, since good grades tend to be a goal for most students. 
As a result, there are a number of limitations that constrain the level of polish student projects can obtain.

At a studio, you can reliably meet and talk about the project every day which makes progress much more likely to happen. 
Students have to plan just to see each other in person. With larger and larger teams this becomes more and more difficult. 
And, as any project manager knows, time spent face to face is drastically the best use of time on a project. 
Items become easier to communicate and can be addressed and solved much more reliably. 
Projects with students have dramatically less face time, and as a result ideas are limited in how far they can be developed.

But I don't think student projects aren't doomed, far from it, they just need to take the above into account when working on a project. 
Students need to realize that their games can't and won't ever reach the levels a studio project can get to. 
They need to learn to scale back their ideas, lower their expectations, and manage themselves in a way tailored to specific projects. 
As the project manager for student projects this is a primary concern of mine going into Capstone.

One way I am aiming to do this is to reinforce the concept of a game which has the potential to be big but only needs a small minimum viable product. 
A good example of this would be the couch game Overcooked. 
This game is a simple concept with several stations that need to be completed in order to continue, but can be expanded nearly infinitely. 
An ideal student game has this type of structure and the basis of the game can be completed within the first week or two of the class. 
From then on we would be honing the game and testing it to find the fun in the minimum viable product.

Now it's easy to say that but the main difficulty here would be making sure that the students still have agency on the product. 
Each discipline needs to have their own reason for working on the game even though we start so small. 
In this sense, during conception meetings I will encourage team members to express their appeals and dislikes on the idea early and often. 
I will also need to be sure to bring up any concerns that I may have with the concept in terms of the aforementioned minimum viable product and expandability. 
However, this is only in the conception phase and during later parts of production I would need to reinforce this notion.

With this article I hope you've gained some insights into the difference in ability of student and studio game development. 
Students have a much more limited amount of time compared to their studio counterparts, and as a result need to keep this in mind early on in their projects. 
I plan to keep this in mind when meeting with my own team next semester, and will be sure to discuss this with them throughout the project.

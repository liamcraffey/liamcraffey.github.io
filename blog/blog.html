					<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Gaining a Product Owner</u></h2>
						<pre>
To anyone outside the realm of Scrum the idea of a Product Owner makes sense. 
They are the person who has full control over the product, and then by extension all the responsibility. 
However, this is not entirely the case in the Scrum framework. 
The Product Owner is the one who has the vision for the product which means they are responsible for making sure the team creates the right product. 
They do this through prioritizing the features the team works on first, and making sure this is constantly up to date. 
Each user story is also important in that it is a way to present a feature in a language that anyone can understand. 
This is useful for when talking to the team since they can all easily estimate how many Story Points to assign to a feature. 
Story Points are relevant only to the development team and represent how “big” a story is compared to others. 
The exact scale of one story point is determined by the team through working with each other, understanding how each other works, and what both of those mean in combination to each other. 
Until this past week our team didn’t have any of these components.

This last weekend I had the wonderful opportunity to take part in a Product Owner Certification course run by Clinton Keith. 
This course is a little unique in that it is primarily directed towards use within a game development project. 
While I had already taken the Scrum Master Certification course last year, 
this past weekend opened my eyes up to how large of an opportunity cost I had undertaken with my team in not implementing three aspects I talked about in the opening paragraph:
 a Product Owner, proper User Stories, and Story points. 
 In turn we’ve made some subtle changes and major changes, so for this post I’ll be going over that in detail.
 
We had all the other artifacts of scrum but I was worried since we didn’t have a single game concept yet. 
Instead we had three that would each require their own sets. 
I thought it too much overhead to implement these artifacts so early on. 
Looking back however I realize that we could have started implementing all three from the very beginning.

First off was that out of all three of our ideas it was clear early on which one we were leaning towards: 0g. 
Additionally, both Tyler and Alana had a lot of faith in Richie to point us in the right direction for all our concepts. 
With these in mind I could have easily suggested we made Richie the product owner for all three concepts. 
This would have given us more structure in those first few weeks while gaining a better understanding of our team dynamics.

For the other two it was more of an error on my part. Looking back there was an early understanding among the team on how much work they could do within a week. 
In addition, User Stories might be complicated to grasp in the beginning, but people only get better at it over time and cause a deeper level of understanding across the team. 
This would only help us at the point we are at now where we are trying to get all aspects of the game into the product backlog using User Stories. 
We would be better at making them and defining them.

Story Points are highly subjective to the team and as a result require time to form a definition for. 
The team could also have used Story Points early on to do several things: be more accurate in their estimates, properly start measuring velocity, and get a better understanding of where we are in relation to Capstone. 
This would put us in a more structure point compared to where we are now and allow us to plan more easily. 
 
However, we didn’t have any of these Scrum Artifacts and this is something that came at me head-on over the weekend. 
While I was sitting in the course I kept thinking of what we needed to do to utilize these for the team’s success. 
The result of this was making Richard Conti, our designer, the product owner and to have a meeting where we estimated some Story Points from past tasks to get a hang of the process. 
This then allowed us to estimate our current backlog, which already had proper user stories in a prioritized order. 
This meeting was longer than our usual weekly Tuesday meeting but now we are in a position as a team to properly plan as much as possible while keeping our team flexible to change.

					<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Deconstruction of Feedback</u></h2>
						<pre>
After studying the industry of game development over the past couple years I've come to understand something fundamental.
Every game developer, from first-timers to seasoned veterans, are just as susceptible to the curse of scope.
One aspect of this behemoth is knowing when to cut a feature and when to press on, especially in regard to how short of a time table game development typically is given.
This affects even large businesses prominent through the unfinished games that have made it to shelves worldwide.
As a result it is imperative for developers to understand when they need to pivot or plow on ahead.

In my first blog post, Game Development: The Student Restriction, I discussed just how little time student development projects have in comparison to full time studios.
This results in a lower average level of quality coming out from game majors since there are a ton of other events constantly happening in a given week.
Thus, it is more important for all student projects to get feedback on their idea early and often in comparison to their industry counterparts.
This past week my team learned something about the core of our game's movement mechanic, but it took the weeks of testing to understand.

When we first challenged one of the major reasons we didn't pass was that we didn't have an answer for choosing a Squid as the player character.
In hindsight we should have seen this coming from a mile away since the game was barely even a concept.
We had a lot of ideas about where we'd go after completing the challenge, but in the process we didn't add any of them.
So when we presented there was only the ability to breach a spaceship that had a decompression system.
The results are plain to see in that we came across as not really understanding out own concept well enough to pass the first stage.

Following this we had a meeting where we started a now regular occurrence: set a Sprint goal.
This goal allows us to properly plan that sprint and get the correct tasks within the sprint.
After that failure we knew the first thing we needed to do was "increase squid by 150%," at least.
We all agreed that for this we needed to add the tentacle ability that would be crucial for movement and combat.
The idea here is that the player would be able to latch onto walls with the tentacles and swing around in gravity dodging the enemy to complete the objective.
Our first iteration for this system was hard to use, broken, insanely buggy, and people hated it.

Now this is a crucial moment for any team where they need to decide: cut, pivot, or persevere on this feature? 
The key to figuring out this decision lies all within the feedback players give you. 
However, one needs to be mindful to understand that it is not only what they say but how they say it along with the context within which it is said. 
A huge component of this process is to understand where you are and where you want to be, and by extension those who can and can't see that vision. 
This early on it would be a mistake to listen to every tester that came across our game since it is so early in development. 
With this understanding we knew that we should take caution of taking the feedback at just face value. 

One aspect that we understood needed to be fixed at face-value was the accuracy of the tentacles. 
In this early state they were heavily inconsistent in regard to what they would or wouldn't latch onto. 
Understanding just how far the tentacles go and how to properly use them took too long for someone to quickly pick up in a prototype level. 
So using the feedback of people's disdain towards the tentacles and our understanding of where we were at in development we prioritized making it easier to use. 
The real challenge came when we heavily improved the usability of the tentacles, but people still were slow and got frustrated by the mechanic. 

Here I could have told the team that was our last opportunity to pull the plug on the mechanic. 
Testers weren't becoming attached to the idea in any capacity and it seemed like they never would. 
Maybe people just didn't want to be a squid in space. 
Yet instead of that we sat together as a team and brainstormed, even if we didn't know it at the time, of what to do to solve this issue. 

We knew people didn't like the tentacles and could see by their play that many of them were barely even using them as well. 
Taking both the negative feedback and their play styles in hand we thought of a reason that might be the cause of both: they didn't know how to use them. 
With this mindset it became obvious that to really test if this mechanic had merit was to first make sure the player knew how to use the tentacles. 
To do this we created a short series of levels that ramped up in difficulty. 
The difference was immediately apparent after the first couple playthroughs. 

People were slowly understanding what they could accomplish with the tentacles as they progress through the levels. 
At first they may have had trouble understanding even how to use them, but by the third level they were swinging themselves around the entire spaceship. 
The improvement also showed up in feedback with tentacles being the dominating favorite feedback for the first time. 
This showed us that this mechanic does have value to players while also providing them depth through mastery. 

If this past testing session hadn't improved in regards to the tentacle feature I would be having a serious talk with the team. 
I can seem myself saying that the feature wasn't working, nobody was understanding it, and that we might want to focus on a different aspect. 
Now it has become cemented as a core part of both the movement and combat systems, but wasn't possible without testing. 

We could have rejected player feedback as unintelligent and dismiss its validity. 
We could have talked back to testers who were playing our game they might not have given us honest answers. 
Through that we would have had a serious misunderstanding of what was important to the players, and maybe even had rejected the idea entirely. 
Instead of all that we thought long and hard about where the game was, what state it was in, and how that related to the feedback given. 
Understanding and accepting all of those things in tandem allowed us to make a better prototype before we even hit Stage 2 of Capstone. 

I can't stress enough how important it is for student game developers to have this understanding early and to utilize it often throughout development. 
We have even less time that AAA studios who still have their games end up littered with bugs and incomplete areas. 
Don't be afraid to face feedback and try to process why players are reacting in that way. 
The fundamental design or direction of a game doesn't have to change because of feedback, but rather how you present it to the player. 
Now I don't want to say this is easy especially to developers who are passionate about their project. 
Many times they can become blind to simple, fast improvements they could have made if they only took the time to listen. 

Thank you for reading, and I hope you test your games often!

								<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Knowing When To Wait</u></h2>
								<pre>
There are a few times when one fails and you take a moment to understand why. 
That cascades into a realization about what the project needs and the steps to make it a reality. 
This past week we did not get through the Initial Concepts challenge, yet I believe that has given us a needed push towards the future.
When preparing for the presentation I made a grave mistake regarding the purpose of the presentation. 
My thought process was that we only needed to present the ideas to the main professor to prove that we had an early concept that could move forward. 
Now I realize that we needed to show that we created a prototype able to move forward instead. 
The difference between these two perspectives is both simple yet potentially confusing. 
One requires more preparation and display of our thought process while the other simply displays the required pieces.

Another aspect that I didn’t take into consideration before the presentation was how the team was used to, and comfortable with, presenting. 
Each person presents in their own style. 
If I had to give a name to my style I would call it ‘improv/rehearsal’ where the main flow is rehearsed but each part is more improv. 
After this challenge presentation I’ve realized the team is used to a style more like that of an ‘overlord.’ 
I define this as more one singular voice leading the group along and pulling people in to talk at specific times. 
Last semester my entire team work with a different producer whose presentation style can more closely be related to an overlord style. 
As a result, our weekly update the previous week went more smoothly since that was the style the group was familiar and had experience with. 
Going forward I will need to gain experience in this style of presenting to lead them, or work with Richie to prepare him to present instead.

Even though we didn’t make it through the challenge we all walked away with what we wanted out of it: direction and feedback on the idea. 
The idea with which we are moving forward is project titled “0g” where the player is a space squid destroying/infiltrating a spaceship. 
In previous weeks this was the concept that received the least amount of feedback from the class, yet is the idea the team is most excited to work on for various reasons. 
Through the challenge presentation we got quality feedback on our concept which can be summed up as a question: why a squid? 
At that time, we had no concrete mechanics to justify the player character being a squid. 
Now that isn’t to say we hadn’t discussed and had planned to implement more squid-like aspects down the line. 
We had but I failed to communicate this in the presentation format leading to a failure of communicating this to the professors in the class. 
Instead we believed we had a solid enough basis to focus on more broad aspects such as technical risks and Quality Assurance testing. 
While these are both important the presentation should have more been directed at our past decisions regarding the three concepts we came up with and the decisions we’ve made up until this point. 
This aspect of the presentation was communicated with us after challenging, and gave us the freedom to focus purely on our 0g concept. 
Instead of worrying about all three we now want to properly define 0g to be prepared to take a deep dive into the concept and see where it can go.

After learning all this one would expect us to be ready to present this week as well, we learned so much! 
However, the team has instead decided to wait another week before challenging again. 
While we feel we are in a solid place to challenge, and know what needs to go into a presentation, there are problems with the current form of the game we want to fix. 
Namely is the movement system we currently have in place. 
We feel that to go onto deep dive this is the most important part since it is why the player should feel like a squid. 
There should be a clear juxtaposition between being a squid in space and being a squid in water, especially with the added mechanic of gravity within the ship compared to dry land on Earth.

We’ve learned a lot from our challenge and has allowed us to really focus our efforts regarding 0g, yet we don’t feel ready to challenge again. 
When we go back we want to be providing an experience that’s at least 150% more squid-like compared to last time. 
To properly do that we feel it’d be best to finish this sprint focusing on the game rather than preparing to present again. 
Thanks for reading, see you next week.

							<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Senior Capstone: Initial Plunge Part 2</u></h2>
							<pre>
This past week was probably the first of many hectic weeks to come throughout this capstone process.
A main proponent of this week’s pressure is that my team is challenging the Initial Concepts stage this week.
However, through this stress I've learned some vital things about our team dynamic, tactics to use going forward, and a better sense of scale.

One thing that I got a good look at this week was how my team members prioritize their weekly tasks.
Specifically I noticed a pattern in regards to the documentation that's required for challenging the stage.
All of us completed the requirements at different times, with some not completed even the day before the submit date.
While this doesn’t pose a large problem now there is a great possibility that it may affect challenging into the future.
To help alleviate this I'm going to talk with the team about a standard scrum practice: higher items on the backlog are higher priority.
Previously we've just been making the tasks but in order for this issue not to crop up at a more important time I feel this issue needs to be addressed now.

Along the lines of communication I have noticed practices and habits that I've been doing which need to be shifted, added, or removed.
Last week I realized that I needed to write more meeting notes for proper documentation and remembrance for future meetings.
This is something I started doing much more regularly but also found that the team wouldn’t be able to see them.
My team actually helped me to remedy this by creating a Discord channel where I can post all the meeting notes.
This helps us in a lot of ways in regards to organization and communication.
For me it helps to get into the habit of doing it more regularly while communicating to me if we met the agenda laid out before.
For the team it provides them a place of reference on topics discuss, decisions made, and important things to remember.
Finally I think the key thing about this is that I posted it directly in the service we use to communicate.
Here everyone can find it much more easily since it is something they regularly have open.

I will be interested to see how these habits develop over the course of this upcoming week and how they affect our team dynamic.
A MUCH shorter blog post this week than previously. I want to change a little how I use this blog.
Instead of trying to focus on each individual task I've done the past week I want to reflect on the big picture and write down main takeaways.
Some weeks will be longer than others but I feel this method will allow me to better reflect, especially later on in the semester.
Thank you for reading!

							<pre>
This post marks the end of week 2! 
Over the past week we’ve slightly narrowed our vision and are now focusing on three of our five prototypes: 0g, Bullet Hell, and Lawn Mower (working titles). 
Each now has their own playable digital prototype with which we can start getting feedback from QA. 
However, my main tasks this week focused on customer and competitor research. 
This has emerged in the form of a more robust competitive market spreadsheet while drafting customer archetypes. 
Both of these required me to implement my previous learning and challenged me with unexpected circumstances.
<br>
<!--<img src="material/CompResearch.png" alt="broken" style="height:360px">-->
My basic competition spreadsheet utilizes organization techniques that I implemented during my Minority Media internship. 
Last week I rummaged through Steam and Google play to get a large amount of potential competitors. 
Then I sat down with my designer and we picked through them to really nail down which were competitors while throwing away those that weren’t. 
In addition to this I added SteamSpy statistics to give us a better understanding of the sales for each title. 
While the Steam Review count is a good bare assessment, if you look at the above image you’ll find some that don’t match up. 
Having both information about sales and the level of discussion from the community will give us a better understanding of the market as a whole later down the road.
<br>
Once I had an idea of each market I took on the task of trying to get input from potential early adopters. 
My idea was to go around campus and talk to students about each concept on a given day. 
I figured that with the amount of video game oriented people here at the college I would have an easier time finding customers instead of online or on the street.  
What I found was that most college students on campus in the middle of the day were too busy to discuss at any length about the ideas, let alone try out a concept. 
Looking forward I might try again at different times on different days to test the waters. 
Even further I might make this a continuous routine in order to find all the early adopters on campus that I can.
<br>
After this failure I realized in order to meet my task deadline I had to search online to get an idea of what our customers might be like or what they might value in each concept. 
A great source for this ended up being Steam reviews and Google Play reviews. 
Going over them I was able to get an basic understanding of not only the people playing these games but also what they find most valuable. 
One of my future tasks may be taking a deeper look into these and fleshing out the customer archetypes more.
<br>
This past week was a lot of taking all the information I have and trying to figure out the best possible answers. 
None of the documents I started today are anywhere near final especially since that we don’t have ideas down pat as of yet. 
However, for going onto next semester I believe it is better to get an understanding of both our customers and the markets we are trying to enter as soon as possible. 
In the upcoming weeks I can expand and refine these documents to incorporate any changes we may come upon. 
Additionally, I want to use the failures I’ve encountered this week to better my work into the future. 
With playable prototypes in hand and outlines of where we want to head I believe that we are in a solid place for so soon after the start of the semester. 
Next week we have a simple goal: challenge the Initial Concepts stage. For us to do this requires more paperwork than one might expect. 
Tune in to learn about what exactly this stage entails and what I needed to work on to meet its specifications. Thank you for reading!

						<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Senior Capstone: Kick-off</u></h2>
						<pre>
Constantly throughout Champlain College I’ve worked with teams to develop a game. 
Capstone sets itself apart in a major way: there isn’t a teacher providing us with a prompt. 
Instead the team is tasked with creating an idea themselves then taking it as far as they want. 
This provides a lot of different opportunities for teams to build their own path, 
but includes a final presentation at the end for teams to continue onto Senior Production. 
However, the grade of Capstone is not tied to completing this step and gives teams a large amount of freedom. 
They could develop many small prototypes or try to home in onto one idea. 
My team is taking the latter route and currently have five prototypes which we are exploring. 
The following series of blog posts will focus on my perspective of the process which will mainly focus on business, management, and organizational topics. 

For this first week, I took the tasks of starting to create value and growth hypotheses for each idea as well as a first draft business model canvas. 
These names are temporary and are not final.
<br>
<img src="./material/0g1.gif" alt="broken" style="width:640px;height:360px">
0g:
This idea started with the mechanic of being in space with no gravity and having a main part of your movement be a result of firing a gun. 
Players are tasked with infiltrating a space ship from the outside, and must strategically take out key systems to complete their objective. 
A main assumption of this idea is that players want to infiltrate a spaceship from the outside. 
Without this key incentive, they wouldn’t have a reason to play the game at all. 
My next steps for this is to analyze testing feedback and find gamers who play sci-fi games and get their input on the idea.
<br>				<!--<img src="./material/Trench.png" alt="broken img" class="rotate90" style="width:360px;height:640;">-->
Trench Warfare:
Instead of focusing purely onto warfare and strategy we want to throw another element into this idea: people. 
The aim of the game is a real-time strategy (RTS) game that puts players in a situation where they need to consider their people, infrastructure, and enemy. 
The main assumption here is that adding people as a factor they must consider is something people are interested in. 
There is proof of this mechanic being successful, as Darkest Dungeon has shown, but we don’t know how RTS fans will react to it. 
Next steps are to not only talk to RTS fans but get feedback from them during testing.
<br>
Alien Autopsy:
A puzzle game where the answer is hidden inside a complex and mysterious alien body. 
Players must tamper and experiment with the insides to discover its rules and figure out what makes it tick. 
The assumption here is that fans of puzzle games want to experiment in this way. 
This might be the weakest of my hypothesis since it is general. 
Next step is to talk with puzzle fans to see what they think and analyze testing feedback.
<br>
<img src="./material/BulletHell1.gif" alt="broken" style="width:640px;height:360px">
Bullet Hell:
Here we want to flip the traditional base shooting mechanic to giving the player abilities that manipulate the bullets coming at them. 
Once they created a safe path they ram their ship into enemies to kill them. 
The main assumption here is that this change would provide an interesting new twist on the genre enough to entice this fanbase. 
Next step is to talk with bullet hell fans and to gather feedback from testing. 
<br>
Lawn Mower:
The main idea here is to provide a Zen experience in the form of mowing a virtual lawn on their phone. 
We would have several types of lawns with several objects in them. 
Of course, in this regard a main assumption is that players would even want to do this to relax and provide one personal fulfilment. 
This is the idea that I have the least regarding a solid next plan. 
I will need to find avid mobile phone users to better understand the mobile player base. 
After that it would be analysing testing feedback.
<br>
In addition to creating the above I also did some preliminary survey of their markets to find any competitors. 
My main goal was to find titles that provide the same type of value as our ideas. 
For this I am using tactics I learned from interning at Minority Studios by making a spreadsheet to start. 
This has the platform, price, rating, the amount of reviews, along with the product page. 
This will allow us to give a good overview of the market and where it is at regarding player base as well as what they expect from a game within that genre. 
Going forward I will be adding onto this spreadsheet continually as we hone into a specific idea. 
<br>
That’s it for this week in terms of what I’ve done at the start of this project. 
Every week I will be adding another post going over what I’ve done the past week, what the team has done, things I’ve learned, and more. 
Each week will also be influenced on what part of the project we are focusing on that week in terms of getting our game to continue next semester. 
Long story short, this consists of challenging several stages in which we need to build out specific parts of our idea. 
Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy!

						<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Game Development: The Student Restriction</u></h2>
						<pre>
This Spring Semester marks the second time that I have worked on a student game development project. 
Before I go into my Senior Capstone, another development cycle, I wanted to collect and share my thoughts on the student process. 
Even during my brief time I've been at Minority Media noticeable differences have been revealed to me. 
This post will provide insights for any project management perspective. 
There are three topics specifically I want to address regarding student compared to studio development; the time frame, the mindset, and the limitations.

While I was preparing to go to MIGS 2016 I heard that the mention of a student project causes an immediate wave of eye-rolling and disinterest.  
This trend, I've been told, extends to GDC and further to industry developers in general. 
As a student, this is disheartening to hear since I want to discuss aspects of the industry with those actually in it. 
However, at the same time, from a student producer perspective this doesn't come as a surprise to me.

A big part of this I feel is the amount of time in general a student has to dedicate to a project. 
Every student has several obligations that they decide to commit time towards. 
I separate these into two categories; school and general activities. 
The school related activities are something unique to student projects, while general related ones are something every studio deals with. 
Yet general activities do not impact a studio developer's time commitment while both school and general activities affect a student's time commitment.

The basis for this is that studios are jobs and as a result the developers are contractually obligated to work on the project. 
A common inclusion into this is a mandatory regular schedule with around eight hours of work a day at the studio. 
During that time employees are expected to work together with their co-workers towards the game. 
This means that on a daily basis, studio developers are working for multiple hours and in close proximity to one another. 
Students do not get either of these privileges that studio developers come to expect. 
This results in a smaller pool of time to commit to a project which is reinforced by the school system itself.

Here is where we start entering the second aspect of student troubles; the student mindset. 
For most students, when they arrive in a college they have been in a school environment for their entire life about 18 years on average. 
As a result, an assumption can be made that they primarily focus on the grade they receive rather than getting fulfilment out of a project. 
A main aspect for going to college is to get away from your home and to figure out who you truly are. 
This effect is compounded by the time commitment since they are more likely to stretch themselves over a number of activities. 
As a result students tend to only dedicate the minimum amount of work to get a good grade.

At Champlain College that minimum amount of "work" is typically defined for them in the class syllabus; eight hours minimum per week. 
While this slightly encourages the students to do the work, it also has a potential limiting factor in how much time they dedicate to the project. 
With the student mindset, commitments and limited time available combine so students have trouble finding the time to work on the project, let alone meet their goals. 
Even senior team members at Champlain College tend to have the mindset where they only need to work eight hours a week. 
This results in a drastically smaller level of commitment and man hours on the typical student project compared to a studio project. 
Additionally, projects only last a semester at most, around four months, which totals around 128 hours of work per student on a project.

This is further compounded through the teachers in the other classes the student is taking. 
They may take a class with a teacher who perceives their class as what the student needs to be focusing on. 
Believing this, the teacher assigns the class a large amount of homework and strictly grades on the work they have submitted. 
Thus, the student is required to spend more time on the class to receive a better grade, since good grades tend to be a goal for most students. 
As a result, there are a number of limitations that constrain the level of polish student projects can obtain.

At a studio, you can reliably meet and talk about the project every day which makes progress much more likely to happen. 
Students have to plan just to see each other in person. With larger and larger teams this becomes more and more difficult. 
And, as any project manager knows, time spent face to face is drastically the best use of time on a project. 
Items become easier to communicate and can be addressed and solved much more reliably. 
Projects with students have dramatically less face time, and as a result ideas are limited in how far they can be developed.

But I don't think student projects aren't doomed, far from it, they just need to take the above into account when working on a project. 
Students need to realize that their games can't and won't ever reach the levels a studio project can get to. 
They need to learn to scale back their ideas, lower their expectations, and manage themselves in a way tailored to specific projects. 
As the project manager for student projects this is a primary concern of mine going into Capstone.

One way I am aiming to do this is to reinforce the concept of a game which has the potential to be big but only needs a small minimum viable product. 
A good example of this would be the couch game Overcooked. 
This game is a simple concept with several stations that need to be completed in order to continue, but can be expanded nearly infinitely. 
An ideal student game has this type of structure and the basis of the game can be completed within the first week or two of the class. 
From then on we would be honing the game and testing it to find the fun in the minimum viable product.

Now it's easy to say that but the main difficulty here would be making sure that the students still have agency on the product. 
Each discipline needs to have their own reason for working on the game even though we start so small. 
In this sense, during conception meetings I will encourage team members to express their appeals and dislikes on the idea early and often. 
I will also need to be sure to bring up any concerns that I may have with the concept in terms of the aforementioned minimum viable product and expandability. 
However, this is only in the conception phase and during later parts of production I would need to reinforce this notion.

With this article I hope you've gained some insights into the difference in ability of student and studio game development. 
Students have a much more limited amount of time compared to their studio counterparts, and as a result need to keep this in mind early on in their projects. 
I plan to keep this in mind when meeting with my own team next semester, and will be sure to discuss this with them throughout the project.

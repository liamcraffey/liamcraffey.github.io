This Spring Semester marks the second time that I have worked on a student game development project.
Before I go into my Senior Project, another development project, I wanted to collect and share my thoughts on the process.
Now I have only had limited experience in an actual studio position, but this story may hold true for any project management perspective.
There are three topics specifically I want to address: the time frame, the mindset, and the limitations.

First and foremost students have a much shorter time frame for game development. 
This is a result of an acclimation of things.
One of these is the amount of time in general a student has to dedicate to a project. 
Each student have a list of commitments that they decide to pursue. 
I separate these into two categories: school related and non-school related.
The school related activities are something unique to student projects, but non-school related ones are something every student deals with.
However, with the addition of the school activities the time a student has available to spend on a project becomes heavily restricted.

Another is the general deadline in which students need to complete the project. 
However, I feel this one is more related to the student mindset.
Most of the projects students start will only last a semester at most, potentially shorter if they are in a program like Champlain's Capstone.
This means that an average project will run for about four months from start to finish.
After working in a studio, I believe this is actually a good time frame since a studio is likely to have a major deadline in a similar period.
The issue stems from the aforementioned time availability. 
Studios not only have a place to work together, but are able to meet there for around eight hours each work day.
At Champlain, having a person work on the project for more than eight hours a week is seen as the exception not the norm.

One of the contributing factors to this is the aforementioned commitments, but another important factor is the student mindset itself.
For most students, when they arrive in a college they have been in a school environment for their entire life, 18 years on average.
As a result, an assumption can be made that they primarily focus on the grade they receive rather than getting fulfilment out of the project.
This effect is compounded by the time commitment since they are more likely to stretch themselves over a number of activities.
Therefore, the game development class may not be their top priority and as a result they want to do the minimum amount of work to get a good grade.

So not only do they have a limited amount of time to commit to a project, students don't tend to have a large drive to work longer than eight hours.
This is further compounded through the teachers in the other classes the student is taking.
They may take a class with a teacher who perceives their class as what the student needs to be focusing on.
Believing this, the teacher assigns the class a large amount of homework and strictly grades the work they submit.
Thus, the student is required to spend more time on the class to receive a batter grade, since good grades tend to be a goal for most students.

There are a number of limitations that stem from the above two points.
One which I believe is the biggest problem is meeting.
At a studio, since you have a space in which you can reliably believe someone is at for around eight hours a day it is easy to work with them.
Students need to plan when to see each other in person. With larger and larger teams this becomes more and more difficult.
And, as any project manager knows, time spent face to face is drastically the best use of time on a project.
There are many things that are easier to communicate and problems are addressed and solved much more easily face to face.
Projects with students have dramatically less face time, and as a result ideas are limited in how far they can be developed.

Now this doesn't mean that it's impossible for a student game to have qualities of a hit, or even become a hit.
However, most are greatly limited in their ability to even have the opportunity to reach that far.
This limitation can be reduced through producers, effective communication, and the like.
Additionally, this can also be viewed as the challenge students need to overcome, and a main point in going to college in the first place.
On the flip side, both of those topics are for another post. Thank you for reading! Hope you learned something new about student game developers.

					<pre>
After graduating high school, I started my secondary education at Champlain College. 
For the past 4 years, I have been studying accounting, marketing, project management, game design, game production, scrum and agile software development, and business. 
Being born on Martha's Vineyard resulted in me developing a passion for the ocean. 
I became involved in a sailing program that I continued for many years. 
I was a selected for a series of expeditions on a three-mast tall ship as an educational experience. 

As Iâ€™ve matured, I developed a deep interest in technology and for several years attended, and taught at, a summer program that specialized in 3-D modeling, Game Design, Programming, and Robotics. 
Over the years my skills have grown to include Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office, Microsoft PowerPoint, quality assurance, html programming, java programming, business methodologies, and personal computer construction. 
I am excited to continue broadening my horizons of the video game industry, software development, marketing, and quality assurance.
